# Uncommon HTML Error: Duplicate ID in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that can occur when using `innerHTML` to insert content.  The error is caused by attempting to insert an element with an ID that already exists within the DOM. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential JavaScript errors. 

The `bug.html` file demonstrates the problematic code. The `bugSolution.html` file shows a corrected version. 

## Bug Explanation

When you use `innerHTML` to modify the content of an element, the browser parses the inserted HTML string and adds it to the DOM. If the inserted HTML contains an element with an ID that already exists in the DOM, you will have duplicate IDs, resulting in unpredictable behavior.  Browsers may handle this in different ways, often leading to JavaScript errors when you try to access an element by its ID later.

## Solution

The best way to avoid this problem is to avoid dynamically creating elements with IDs that could conflict with existing elements.  You can use alternative methods like using classes or creating unique IDs programmatically, to ensure unique element identifiers.
